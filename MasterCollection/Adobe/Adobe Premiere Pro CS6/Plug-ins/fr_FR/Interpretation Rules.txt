# Premiere pixel aspect ratio rules and names
# note: Premiere only uses the width, height, and pixel aspect ratio information
#
# adapted from:
# "Interpretation Rules.txt"
# After Effects 4.1 Automatic Footage Interpretation
#  
# lines beginning with "#" are comments
#
# basic format of a rule: {match requirements} = {set interpretation}
#
# + for each rule that matches, the interpretation is set; wild-cards ("*") allowed
#   on both sides; wildcard match matches anything, wildcard set sets nothing
# + multiple rules are allowed to match, later matches override earlier matches
# + all rules are scanned in order, one rule per line
# + rules are applied after the automatic setting of D1 pixel aspect and automatic
#	field separation from field-labeled files
#
# width, height, frame-rate, file-type, codec = 
# 	pixel aspect ratio/name, field order, conform frame-rate, alpha interp
#
# width & height are integer numbers
# frame-rate is a decimal number
# file-type is four characters in quotes (4c's)
# codec (applicable for QT & AVI only) is also 4c's
#
# the pixel aspect ratio is a ratio of integers (e.g. 10/11)
#   optionally followed by a name for that ratio (e.g. 10/11/"My Aspect")
# the field order is a single character, (F=frame, U=upper field, or L=lower field)
# the conform frame-rate is a decimal number
# alpha interp: (I=ignore, S=straight, P=premul/black, W=premul/white)
#	alpha interp is ignored for footage without an alpha channel
